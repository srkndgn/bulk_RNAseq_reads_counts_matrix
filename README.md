RNA-Seq Data Processing Workflow Readme
Overview
This repository contains a detailed workflow for processing bulk RNA-Seq reads (fastq) to generate a counts matrix for downstream analysis. The pipeline involves quality control, trimming, alignment, and quantification steps. The tools used include FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, Samtools, and featureCounts. The workflow is designed for Linux environments, and Conda is utilized for managing dependencies and environments.

Prerequisites
Before running the pipeline, ensure that Conda is installed on your system. Additionally, make sure to set up the necessary channels and install the required packages as specified in the code.

bash
Copy code
# List out channels
conda config --show channels

# Add the bioconda channel:
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
Environment Setup
Create Conda environments for the tools used in the pipeline:

Trimmomatic
HISAT2
Samtools
Subread (featureCounts)
bash
Copy code
# Example for Trimmomatic
conda create --name trimmomatic
conda activate trimmomatic
conda install trimmomatic
conda deactivate
Repeat the above steps for HISAT2, Samtools, and Subread.

Execution
Quality Control and Trimming:

Run FastQC for initial and trimmed reads:

bash
Copy code
fastqc data/demo.fastq -o data/
Trim reads using Trimmomatic:

bash
Copy code
conda activate trimmomatic
trimmomatic SE -threads 4 demo.fastq demo_trimmed.fastq TRAILING:10 -phred33
conda deactivate
Run FastQC again for trimmed reads:

bash
Copy code
conda activate RNAseq_env2
fastqc data/demo_trimmed.fastq -o data/
Alignment with HISAT2:

Download genome indices and perform alignment:

bash
Copy code
conda activate hisat2
hisat2 -q --rna-strandness R -x HISAT2/grch38/genome -U data/demo_trimmed.fastq | samtools sort -o HISAT2/demo_trimmed.bam
conda deactivate
Quantification with featureCounts:

Download the annotation file (gtf) and run featureCounts:

bash
Copy code
conda activate subread
featureCounts -S 2 -a Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf -o demo_featurecounts.txt HISAT2/demo_trimmed.bam
conda deactivate
Check the generated count files:

bash
Copy code
cat demo_featurecounts.txt.summary
cat demo_featurecounts.txt | less
To see only gene names and corresponding counts:

bash
Copy code
cat demo_featurecounts.txt | cut -f1,7 | less
Additional Information
Channel Configuration:

Use conda config --show channels to list configured channels.
Bioconda, defaults, and conda-forge channels are added for package installation.
Environment Export:

The script includes instructions to export and share Conda environment specifications using .yml files.
Local Versions:

Specify local versions for tools such as FastQC, Perl, and Picard during environment creation.
Note on Installing Packages:

It is recommended to avoid installing additional packages into the base software environment.
